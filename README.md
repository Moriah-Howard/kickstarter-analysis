# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	This analysis is to guide and inform the customer regarding using KickStarter 
to fund her theatrical production. By using capabilities within Excel to slice, dice, 
and present the information we are better able to determine an appropriate course of 
action and develop a game plan to >get the show on the road.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	The analysis of outcomes based on launch date show that the most likely month
to launch a successful campaign is May (reference chart (/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)).
Analysis shows that the least successful month to launch is October. The analysis 
also shows that 2% of campaigns are cancelled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	The analysis of outcomes based on goals show that the most successful goal range 
is less than $1000 with 141 successful projects, or a 76% success rate. The least 
successful goal range is $45000 to $49999 with a 100% failure rate. The analysis also 
shows $50000 or more as the second least successful, with a 13% success rate and 88% 
failure rate. Please reference (/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	One of the challenges encountered was narrowing the data to work with without 
disregarding applicable data. Using the pivot tables encouraged me to filter different 
data to find what tells the entire story. Another challenge I faced was charting the refined 
data in a means that made it easy to understand and tell the appropriate story. All the 
charts represented the data but some styles were easier to understand and compare data 
quickly. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Two conclusions that I've drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are that 
it is more successful if you launch in the summer (April - August) and December is the most 
difficult time to launch. The average number of successes in the summer (April - August) is 
88.2 with a success rate of 64%. December has a 49% success rate.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	85% (889 projects out of 1047 total projects) have a goal of less than $10000. Of that 
85%, 70% have successful outcomes. I hypothesize that breaking a larger goal into a set of 
smaller goals will increase the chances for success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	Some limitations of this dataset are that we are only looking at the theatrical category. 
Other categories, such as film and video, may have data relevent to the theater categories that is 
being discarded. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	Other tables and graphs to create would be number of backers compared to total funds raised. 
It would also be interesting to see total funds raised of period of time.
